I'm a PhD candidate at Stanford University in the [Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources](https://earth.stanford.edu/eiper) and am coadvised by [Erin Mordecai](https://www.mordecailab.com/) in the Department of Biology and [Marshall Burke](https://www.stanfordecholab.com/) in the Department of Earth System Science. Broadly I'm interested in how environmental conditions affect human health and well-being. My specific research has focused on the conditions that align to allow yellow fever virus to spillover from non-human primates into human populations in Brazil and how gold-mining may be affecting malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon.
