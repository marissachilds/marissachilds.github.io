I'm a PhD candidate at Stanford University studying the effects of environmental conditions on mosquito-borne disease transmission. Broadly I'm interested in how environmental conditions affect human health and well-being. My specific research has focused on the conditions that align to allow yellow fever virus to spillover from non-human primates into human populations in Brazil and how gold-mining may be affecting malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon.
